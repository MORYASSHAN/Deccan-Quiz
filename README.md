🔗 **Live Website:**  (https://deccan-snowy.vercel.app/)

Deccan Quiz is my **first full-stack website built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.
This project marks the beginning of my journey into full-stack web development and demonstrates my understanding of frontend, backend, database integration, and deployment.

# 📌 Project Overview

Deccan Quiz is a modern, full-stack website developed using the MERN stack architecture.

The main purpose of this project was to:

* Learn how full-stack applications work
* Understand client-server architecture
* Build REST APIs
* Connect a React frontend with a Node.js backend
* Store and manage data using MongoDB
* Deploy a production-ready website

This project helped me gain practical experience in real-world web development.

# 🏗️ Tech Stack

## 🟢 Frontend

* React.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Axios (API communication)

## 🔵 Backend

* Node.js

### Application Flow:

1. User interacts with the website interface.
2. React sends API requests to the backend.
3. Express server processes the request.
4. Backend communicates with MongoDB.
5. Data is returned as JSON.
6. React updates the UI dynamically.
